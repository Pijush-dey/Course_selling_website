# Course_selling_website

Overview of the website design :-
This is the website of a private institute, where a short description is given about the courses offered by the institute to its students and the teachers who will teach those courses.
And if the student wants to pay tcan enroll himself/herself in the course, he/she has to pay the price of the course. But before that, he/she has to regsiter himeself/herself in the website.
In any case, if the user forget the password and user is unable to sgn in to the website, then user can reset the password. For this, the user has to click on the link of "Forget password?" and after that user will receive a mail and user will be able to change the password.

Admin Panel :-
Here, The admin can add/remove courses along with its details. He can also add/remove teachers along with their profile photo, short description etc. and the web page wil change itself dynamically. Because I use Flex box method to design the web page.
The admin can also check the details of the students.
